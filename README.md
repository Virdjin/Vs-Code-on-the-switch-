## Intro

Hello and welcome back to part two of our Linux guide. We will be installing visual studio code on our Nintendo switch. It's a fairly simple process which is great, but there's a little bit of a workaround.

## Part 1

First, we're going to start by going to our browser, then go to the virtual studio code website and look for the "other software tab". Now download the 
"deb. ARM 64 file".

## Part 2

Once it's downloaded, go to the terminal and we're going to make sure we have a certain package installer. 
Now type "sudo apt install gdebi-core -y"
and that should do. Arm 64 can be weird at times with downloads and this is what I found the most success with.

## part 3

Now let's navigate to the "downloads" folder.
look for the file that starts with "code"
Now, copy the whole name and open up the terminal from the "downloads" folder

## Part 4
And type "sudo gdebi" and paste the name of the file and hit enter. Now we should be good to go. Type "vs" in the menu bar and go to vs code.

Now, we have a nice little developing environment.
By the way, the screenshots and  editing was done on the switch itself.
